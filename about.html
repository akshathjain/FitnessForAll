			<h3 class="section-header">PROJECT PARADIGM</h3>

			<p>This website was entered into Project Paradigm’s: The Paradigm Challenge as a website entry. Fitness For All is a website that outlines a potential solution to the obesity epidemic in the United States while also increasing health insurance coverage. By using wearable fitness trackers to offer health insurance discounts based on an individual’s daily average steps (among other fitness heuristics), we hope to increase exercise, decrease obesity, and make health insurance more affordable for everyone. Check out our <a href="concept.html">Concept</a> and some <a href="stats.html">Statistics</a> for more information!</p>

			<h3 class="section-header">DIMENSIONS OF WELLNESS</h3>

			<p><b>Overview</b></p>
			<p>In 1976 Dr. Bill Hettler, co-founder of the <a href="http://www.nationalwellness.org/?page=six_dimensions" target="_blank">National Wellness Institute</a>, developed the dimensions of wellness. Many interpretations and models later, the eight primary dimensions now include:
				<ol>
					<li>Social wellness—creating and maintaining healthy relationships</li>
					<li>Physical wellness—partaking in daily physical activity</li>
					<li>Emotional wellness—maintaining a positive attitude about life</li>
					<li>Career wellness—making choices that lead to work satisfaction</li>
					<li>Intellectual wellness—expanding and sharing personal knowledge</li>
					<li>Environmental wellness—taking responsibility for, actively improving, and engaging with the surrounding ecological community</li>
					<li>Spiritual wellness—being at peace with one’s purpose in life</li>
					<li>Financial wellness—understanding and managing finances and expenses</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<br>

			<p><b>How does Fitness For All encompass the Dimensions of Wellness?</b></p>
			<p>Fitness For All directly improves several of the dimensions of wellness. The primary categories are physical and financial wellness; however, there also exist ancillary improvements in intellectual and environmental wellness. The Fitness For All <a href="concept.html">Concept</a> encourages individuals to get more exercise—thereby improving physical wellness—in order to save money on health insurance, which improves financial wellness. Side benefits of the outlined <a href="concept.html">Concept</a> include being more knowledgeable about personal health—thus improving intellectual wellness—and interacting more with the environment by encouraging increased outdoor activity, which improves environmental wellness. And while these are the most obvious improvements, positive impacts to the other four categories can definitely be argued for. In short, living a healthier lifestyle will undoubtedly lead to a more positive life.</p>

			<p>The Fitness For All Logo is a symbolic representation of “Fitness For All” and is broken into two parts to do so. The first aspect of the logo, the letter F, represents Fitness. The second part of the logo, the ∀, is a mathematical symbol (most commonly used in discrete mathematics while writing proofs) that means “for all.” So when put together, the logo directly represents “Fitness For All.”</p>
