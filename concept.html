		<h3>AN OVERVIEW</h3>
		
		<div class="info-container">
			<img class="img-scalable info-image" src="images/smartwatchphone.svg" style="height: 450px;">
			<h3>Healthcare Discounts Based on Fitness</h3>
			<p>The Concept is simple: offer healthcare discounts based on how much you walk everyday. By using wearable fitness trackers—such as <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/home" target="_blank">Fitbits</a>—that can interface with smartphones, insurance providers can accurately gauge an individual's average step count and provide discounts accordingly. A solution like this incentivizes individuals to exercise more in order to reap larger discounts while also making health insurance more affordable for everyone!</p>
			
			<br><br><br><br>

			<img class="img-scalable info-image" src="images/dollarsign.svg">
			<h3>Money Motivates</h3>
			<p>Don’t believe us? That’s okay. Take a look at the research instead! A <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2011/02/workplace_wellness_programs_ha.html" target="_blank">2007 Amway initiative</a> that offered health care discounts to employees that worked out regularly in their office gym saw over 90 percent of its employees voluntary enroll. In fact, the program was such as success that all but 11 of their 2,912 participants received full healthcare discounts. Another study published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3354976/" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a> found that similar programs to the FFA model motivated increased exercise and saw active participants decrease their medical and prescription costs by 8 percent whereas nonparticipants actually saw the same costs increase by 2 percent.</p>

			<br><br><br><br>

			<h3>The Simplified Logistics</h3>
			<p>
				Healthcare itself is a <a href="https://cals.ncsu.edu/news/you-decide-how-is-economics-involved-in-health-insurance/" target="_blank">very complicated economic, political, and social issue</a> with hundreds of variables acting simultaneously. However, the basics of how it works is quite simple to understand. Every person who buys health insurance from a particular company pays a monthly cost. The company then collects all of this money and holds onto it. When someone who has coverage gets sick, the company dips into its pool of money and helps pay for the treatment with the hope being that not everyone gets sick at the same time. (If everyone did get sick at the same time the company would run out of money). 
				<br><br>
				The pool of money that the company has varies depending on a few factors. Consider these two scenarios: In the first scenario, everyone who buys insurance from the company gets sick very often. Because of this, the company needs a lot of money to help everyone when they get sick, so each person pays a high monthly cost. In the second scenario, however, the individuals rarely get sick, so the pool of money can be smaller since the insurance company doesn’t need to dip into it as often. Because the pool of money is smaller, each person has to pay a lower monthly cost. 
				<br><br>
				This is where the Fitness For All model comes into play. By encouraging more people to exercise and lead healthier lifestyles, healthcare costs would go down because less people would be suffering from illnesses related to a lack of exercise. Therefore, since less people would be getting sick, the pool of money the company needs would decrease, allowing individuals who exercise to receive healthcare discounts.
			</p>

			<br><br><br><br>

			<h3>Benefits to the Consumer</h3>
			<p>
				The Fitness For All model yields three primary benefits to the consumer:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Encourage physical fitness—All benefits of the FFA model are accessed through pursuing a healthier lifestyle. In fact, meeting the recommended fitness guidelines can help individuals avoid <a href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_adults/en/" target="_blank">conditions</a> such as:
						<ul>
							<li>Death</li>
							<li>Coronary heart disease</li>
							<li>High blood pressure</li>
							<li>Stroke</li>
							<li>Obesity</li>
							<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
							<li>Metabolic syndrome</li>
							<li>Colon and breast cancer</li>
							<li>Depression</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Decreased health insurance cost for an individual—Let’s say that a provider offers a $0.10 discount for every 1,000 steps a person walks. Everyday for a month, that person walks 10,000 steps. At the end of the month the person would save $30 (10,000 steps per day * 30 days / 1,000 steps * $0.10) on their bill!</li>
					<li>Greater access to healthcare—<a href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/" target="_blank">A Kaiser Family Foundation report</a> found that 45% of the 28.2 million uninsured Americans cite the high cost of healthcare as the number reason for not enrolling. However, if these people sign up with a provider that uses the FFA model, then by utilizing the monthly exercise discounts, they may potentially be able to afford the insurance plans. In fact, studies have shown that in general, when costs decrease by just one percent, an additional 400,000 Americans are able to afford healthcare (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nBOPpkGNodkC&pg=PA18444&lpg=PA18444&dq=%22one+percent+decrease+in+premiums%22&source=bl&ots=22fL87FLZU&sig=t0GnH_e5kKPXUnUxTEnpt4Ka8J4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJhImC3dvaAhVFmVkKHZK3BEMQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=%22one%20percent%20decrease%20in%20premiums%22&f=false" target="_blank">Lewin Group</a>)!</li>
				</ol>
				More statistics about exercise, obesity, heart disease, and healthcare can be found on the <a href="stats.html">Stats</a> page.
			</p>

			<br><br><br><br>

			<h3>Benefits to the Provider</h3>
			<p>
				Implementation of the FFA model at a health insurance provider level yields several economic benefits, including decreased cost per consumer and increased revenue flow.
				<ol>
					<li>
						A decreased cost per consumer surfaces since individuals are more incentivized to lead healthier lifestyles. Numerous studies have concluded causal relationships between physical fitness and decreased medical costs. For example, a <a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exercise-can-help-keep-medical-costs-down" target="_blank">2016 American Heart Association</a> study outlined that active and fit adults have medical costs that are on average $2,500 lower than their sedentary counterparts. This equates to tremendous savings for providers.
					</li>
					<li>
						By decreasing health insurance costs by even one percent, accessibility to plans could be opened up to an additional 400,000 people (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nBOPpkGNodkC&pg=PA18444&lpg=PA18444&dq=%22one+percent+decrease+in+premiums%22&source=bl&ots=22fL87FLZU&sig=t0GnH_e5kKPXUnUxTEnpt4Ka8J4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJhImC3dvaAhVFmVkKHZK3BEMQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=%22one%20percent%20decrease%20in%20premiums%22&f=false" target="_blank">Lewin Group</a>). The FFA model would decrease the effective cost of insurance, allowing more people to purchase plans. Ideally, this would increase the number of consumers which would increase the revenue stream.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<br><br><br><br>

			<h3>How is this different from Pay-For-Performance (P4P) plans?</h3>
			<p>
				A Pay-For-Performance plan, or <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pay-for-performance-doctors-hospitals/" target="_blank">P4P plan</a>, is the general term used for describing payroll models in which doctors and hospitals are paid based on their performance (number of patients cured, number of successful surgeries, etc). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16219882" target="_blank">Study</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3026849/" target="_blank">after</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653973/" target="_blank">study</a> has concluded the inefficacy of such programs. Allocating government funding and hospital salaries based on performance actually disincentivizes hospitals and doctors from providing adequate treatment to patients—rather, they are much more focused on getting large numbers of patients in and out the door. 
				<br><br>
				The model described by Fitness For All, however, is an opt-in program in which individuals decide whether or not they would like to receive discounts on health insurance costs. While P4P plans are focused on hospitals and doctors, the FFA model is focused solely on individuals. This model is much more sustainable since doctors and hospitals are in no way affected by how much or how little a person exercises—the quality of patient care is identical whether an individual walks 5,000 steps or 15,000 steps per day. The only difference between exercise levels is the magnitude of the health care discount an individual receives. 
			</p>

			<br><br><br><br>

			<h3>What exactly is Fitness For All? Is it a company, model, or something else entirely?</h3>
			<p>
				Fitness For All, or FFA, is just a website to outline a potential solution to a problem: namely, the obesity epidemic. This website serves as a platform to disseminate information about the FFA model (healthcare discounts based on exercise) to anyone who’s interested. As of now, companies, if they’re willing, can implement the FFA model on a trial basis to see how it works.
				<br><br>
				Hopefully, if this idea gains traction, we may start development on tools to allow insurance companies to easily integrate the FFA model into their business plan. This will most likely include cross-platform smartphone apps (Android and iOS) that interface with fitness devices as well as developer tools and APIs to make integration seamless.

		<h3>FAQ</h3>

		<div class="faq">
			<div class="row row-margin">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>How will my insurance provider know how much I walk?</h3>
					<p>Your fitness device should be able to connect to a smartphone app via a bluetooth connection. This app will then allow you to view your stats and enable you to send your exercise data to your insurance provider so they can provide a discount.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>How will my discount be calculated?</h3>
					<p>Based on how many steps you take per month and how much of a discount your provider gives per 1,000 steps, your discount will be calculated. Check out our Calculator to see how much you could save!</p>
					<a class="btn-custom btn-dark-text" href="#savingscalculator">CALCULATOR</a>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>What if I don’t walk that much?</h3>
					<p>That’s completely okay! We encourage you to get as much exercise as you can, but if you have an extremely busy schedule and are unable to, there will be no negative consequences.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row row-margin">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Do I need to buy my own fitness tracker?</h3>
					<p>Ideally, no. But it all depends from company to company and how large each of their programs are. But don’t worry if you need to purchase it yourself—many wearable devices today are relatively inexpensive.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Aren’t fitness wearables expensive?</h3>
					<p>Some can definitely costs hundreds of dollars. However, the vast majority of trackers are relatively inexpensive and can be purchased for around $20. Ideally, however, your insurance company will provide you with a wearable device.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Will only my step count be tracked?</h3>
					<p>Daily/monthly step count is the easiest way to track your fitness levels. However, in the future, it is possible that companies can have opt-in programs where you can choose to share more data for even bigger discounts!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row row-margin">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>Will my data be sold?</h3>
					<p>Absolutely not! You own your data. Your insurance provider is only accessing it to gauge how large your discount should be.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<h3>What if I make a machine to “walk” for me?</h3>
					<p>Trying to “game” the system is highly discouraged. Doing so will most likely result in you losing the ability to earn discounts at all. Additionally, by using advanced machine learning algorithms, companies will be able to verify that your steps are legitimate. </p>
