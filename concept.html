		<h3>AN OVERVIEW</h3>
		
		<div class="info-container">
			<img class="img-scalable info-image" src="images/smartwatchphone.svg" style="height: 450px;">
			<h3>Healthcare Discounts Based on Fitness</h3>
			<p>The Concept is simple: offer healthcare discounts based on how much you walk everyday. By using wearable fitness trackers—such as <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/home" target="_blank">Fitbits</a>—that can interface with smartphones, insurance providers can accurately gauge an individual's average step count and provide discounts accordingly. A solution like this incentivizes individuals to exercise more in order to reap larger discounts while also making health insurance more affordable for everyone!</p>
			
			<br><br><br><br>

			<img class="img-scalable info-image" src="images/dollarsign.svg">
			<h3>Money Motivates</h3>
			<p>Don’t believe us? That’s okay. Take a look at the research instead! A <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2011/02/workplace_wellness_programs_ha.html" target="_blank">2007 Amway initiative</a> that offered health care discounts to employees that worked out regularly in their office gym saw over 90 percent of its employees voluntary enroll. In fact, the program was such as success that all but 11 of their 2,912 participants received full healthcare discounts. Another study by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3354976/" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a> found that similar programs to the FFA model motivated increased exercise and saw active participants decrease their medical and prescription costs by 8 percent whereas nonparticipants actually saw the same costs increase by 2 percent.</p>

			<br><br><br><br>

			<h3>The Simplified Logistics</h3>
			<p>
				Healthcare itself is a <a href="https://cals.ncsu.edu/news/you-decide-how-is-economics-involved-in-health-insurance/" target="_blank">very complicated economic, political, and social issue</a> with hundreds of variables acting simultaneously. However, the basics of how it works is quite simple to understand. Every person who buys health insurance from a particular company pays a monthly cost. The company then collects all of this money and holds onto it. When someone who has coverage gets sick, the company dips into its pool of money and helps pay for the treatment with the hope being that not everyone gets sick at the same time. (If everyone did get sick at the same time the company would run out of money). 
				<br><br>
				The pool of money that the company has varies depending on a few factors. Consider these two scenarios: In the first scenario, everyone who buys insurance from the company gets sick very often. Because of this, the company needs a lot of money to help everyone when they get sick, so each person pays a high monthly cost. In the second scenario, however, the individuals rarely get sick, so the pool of money can be smaller since the insurance company doesn’t need to dip into it as often. Because the pool of money is smaller, each person has to pay a lower monthly cost. 
				<br><br>
				This is where the Fitness For All model comes into play. By encouraging more people to exercise and lead healthier lifestyles, healthcare costs would go down because less people would be suffering from illnesses related to a lack of exercise. Therefore, since less people would be getting sick, the pool of money the company needs would decrease, allowing individuals who exercise to receive healthcare discounts.
			</p>

			<br><br><br><br>

			<h3>Benefits to the Consumer</h3>
			<p>
				The Fitness For All model yields two primary benefits to the consumer:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Encourage physical fitness—All benefits of the FFA model are accessed through pursuing a healthier lifestyle. In fact, meeting the recommended fitness guidelines can help individuals avoid <a href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_adults/en/" target="_blank">conditions</a> such as:
						<ul>
							<li>Death</li>
							<li>Coronary heart disease</li>
							<li>High blood pressure</li>
							<li>Stroke</li>
							<li>Obesity</li>
							<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
							<li>Metabolic syndrome</li>
							<li>Colon and breast cancer</li>
							<li>Depression</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Increase health insurance coverage—<a href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/" target="_blank">A Kaiser Family Foundation report</a> found that 45% of the 28.2 million uninsured Americans cite the high cost of healthcare as the number reason for not enrolling. By offering just a one percent discount, the FFA model could allow an additional 400,000 Americans to afford healthcare (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nBOPpkGNodkC&pg=PA18444&lpg=PA18444&dq=%22one+percent+decrease+in+premiums%22&source=bl&ots=22fL87FLZU&sig=t0GnH_e5kKPXUnUxTEnpt4Ka8J4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJhImC3dvaAhVFmVkKHZK3BEMQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=%22one%20percent%20decrease%20in%20premiums%22&f=false" target="_blank">Lewin Group</a>)!</li>
				</ol>
				More statistics about exercise, obesity, heart disease, and healthcare can be found on the <a href="stats.html">Stats</a> page.
			</p>

			<br><br><br><br>

			<h3>Benefits to the Provider</h3>
			<p>
				Implementation of the FFA model at a health insurance provider level yields several economic benefits, including decreased cost per consumer and increased revenue flow.
				<ol>
					<li>
						A decreased cost per consumer surfaces since individuals are more incentivized to lead healthier lifestyles. Numerous studies have concluded causal relationships between physical fitness and decreased medical costs. For example, a <a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exercise-can-help-keep-medical-costs-down" target="_blank">2016 American Heart Association</a> study outlined that active and fit adults have medical costs that are on average $2,500 lower than their sedentary counterparts. This equates to tremendous savings for providers.
					</li>
					<li>
						By decreasing health insurance costs by even one percent, accessibility to plans could be opened up to an additional 400,000 people (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nBOPpkGNodkC&pg=PA18444&lpg=PA18444&dq=%22one+percent+decrease+in+premiums%22&source=bl&ots=22fL87FLZU&sig=t0GnH_e5kKPXUnUxTEnpt4Ka8J4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJhImC3dvaAhVFmVkKHZK3BEMQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=%22one%20percent%20decrease%20in%20premiums%22&f=false" target="_blank">Lewin Group</a>). The FFA model would decrease the effective cost of insurance, allowing more people to purchase plans. Ideally, this would increase the number of consumers which would increase the revenue stream.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<br><br><br><br>

			<h3>How is this different from Pay-For-Performance (P4P) plans?</h3>
			<p>
				A Pay-For-Performance plan, or <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/30/pay-for-performance-doctors-hospitals/" target="_blank">P4P plan</a>, is the general term used for describing payroll models in which doctors and hospitals are paid based on their performance (number of patients cured, number of successful surgeries, etc). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16219882" target="_blank">Study</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3026849/" target="_blank">after</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653973/" target="_blank">study</a> has concluded the inefficacy of such programs. Allocating government funding and hospital salaries based on performance actually disincentivizes hospitals and doctors from providing adequate treatment to patients—rather, they are much more focused on getting large numbers of patients in and out the door. 
				<br><br>
				The model described by Fitness For All, however, is an opt-in program in which individuals decide whether or not they would like to receive discounts on health insurance costs. While P4P plans are focused on hospitals and doctors, the FFA model is focused solely on individuals. This model is much more sustainable since doctors and hospitals are in no way affected by how much or how little a person exercises—the quality of patient care is identical whether an individual walks 5,000 steps or 15,000 steps per day. The only difference between exercise levels is the magnitude of the health care discount an individual receives.
